# enzo cli

## Why

The command line is the primary interaction mechanism for me at present.

## Requirements

`enzo` cli which will act as the base command for various functions of enzo.

## Implementation

The implementation could be done using a command line application framework. As the primary computer language used in my
work is Golang, `enzo cli` will be written using Golang. [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra) could be used as the
framework.
